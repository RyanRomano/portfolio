Hello,

My name is Ryan Romano and I am a well-rounded developer, and have recently have been focusing primarily on web development.

I most recently have worked at <Carrot Creative> as a Web Development Intern.  At Carrot, I collaborated with the development, design, and several other teams to build and develop client and internal projects.

To list a few:

- A goodbye magazine from the Interns: zine.bycarrot.com
- The .com for the holding company of Carl's JR / Hardee's: www.ckr.com
- A mock tourist site to market the Netflix Original series Ozark <www.visitozark.info>






I have previously worked with an ad agency, Carrot Creative, as a web developer intern. My experience includes HTML5/CSS3/JS, React, and MVC frameworks like Ruby on Rails, and Laravel. Additionally I have experience working with tools like Refinery CMS, AWS, Github, and some exposure to PostgreSQL and SQLite.

The time I spent at Carrot allowed me to learn and work with the latest technology and collaborate with design and analytic teams. I am comfortable working in a team of developers and on individual projects. I have contributed to larger scale websites ( - Carl's Jr./Hardee's) and developed smaller sites by myself ( - Netflix original series Ozark) during my time there. Additional samples of my web work include www.zine.bycarrot.com and www.alivenj.bitballoon.com.

The great digital content produced at Clear is very similar to Carrot's client work, and I feel that my experience there would allow me to become a great addition to the team. If any similar position is available, I would be thrilled to interview for it. I have included my resume and can be reached by email or at 6095580842, and will reach out shortly.

Thanks for your consideration
